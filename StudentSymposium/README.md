# Team Reflection Paragraphs: 


## Beethoven
Attending the symposium was a decent experience. It was intriguing to find a variety of projects, extending beyond the typical computer science scope. It gave us a chance to present our project and get some fresh perspectives, which was refreshing amidst our intense final year. Although judges didnâ€™t stop by our project for very long, the interaction with attendees from various backgrounds was beneficial. It provided a brief yet meaningful diversion from our usual academic routine.


## Ethan
Real talk, I had a great time.
I wouldn't describe myself as _good_ at talking to people, but the fact that we needed to pull in five people gave me the chance to go goblin mode a little bit and I appreciate that. Funnily enough, I didn't pay any attention at all to any other project at the event. I'm sure there was neat stuff around, but I was just so occupied with our little corner that I never felt inclined to take a look. I do know that none of their posters were as eye-catching as ours, so how come we didn't win the award? Also I ate cheese and it was pretty good.


## Peter
Attending the symposium was a positive experience overall. I had the opportunity to engage with passersby and effectively communicate the essence of our project. Interacting with individuals from diverse backgrounds allowed me to tailor my explanations to different levels of understanding, enhancing my ability to articulate complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. Overall, the symposium was a fruitful experience that not only allowed me to showcase our project but also enabled me to expand my communication skills and connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation and research.


## Tommy
The presentation at the symposium was interesting. I thought it would just be mostly cs projects but I also saw a couple of fashion and other project that didn't pertain to the cs department. It felt good to present our project and show how much we have accomplished. I was surprise when I heard there were judges walking around even though they didn't stop by our project. Overall it was a new experience going to an event full of other study and people I don't know to talk about something I've worked on with a team.
