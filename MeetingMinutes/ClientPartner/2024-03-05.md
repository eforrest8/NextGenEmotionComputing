## Meeting End Time

## Location/Medium
Client Site Lab (1250 Indiana Ave)
## Present
Beethoven, Ethan, Alicia (Peter and Tommy could not physically attend due to already planned Spring Break events. We could not schedule another day, this client meeting had to happen at this very time.)
## Minute Recorder
Beethoven Meginnis
## Topics Discussed
Iteration 5 features: Shave timestamps off for greater readability. Get heart rate variability working (was working previously). Reset my password (password forget functionality). If a user deletes their data, we need to keep that data on the admin side. Try to ensure that datetimes are truly local. Can we test without docker? 
## Things Clarified
We need to be able to transfer the admin account to Dr. Mckoy. Dr. Mckoy needs to know what is set as public in github. We will need to transfer our github repos to Dr. Mckoy's. We need to communicate this over email so that she can accept the transfer. 
## Client Use of the Project
### How did the client use the software?

### What features did they test in your software?

### How long did they use your software?
Dr. Mckoy was present and worked along side Ethan to test the software for several hours. Her actual use of the VR headset lasted approximately 2 minutes in total. She then navigated the webapp menu to discover the uploaded and displayed video as well as the other more minor changes we had made to the session dashboard. This also lasted approxmately 2-3 minutes. 
### How was their reaction to the software?

### Did you recognize anything unusual/different/good/bad?

### Issues (any usability, functionality, etc issues)
