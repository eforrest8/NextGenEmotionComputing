## Topics Discussed
Iteration 5 features: Shave timestamps off for greater readability. Get heart rate variability working (was working previously). Reset my password (password forget functionality). We also discussed about server access for the project and what other important features that could be added to the project. We talked about the build being able to upload properly with the simulation but with the actual vr headset it was saving an empty files.
## Things Clarified
We clarified to Dr.Mckoy the goals of our visit and what we each have done up until now. We let her know that the features she gave us last client meetings are being worked on but also other features that we wanted to run by her before starting.
