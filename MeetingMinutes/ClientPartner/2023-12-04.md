## Topics Discussed
We discussed our progress and road blcoks with setting up AWS. Dr. Mckoy instructed us to contact our professor for additional help. Worse comes to worse, we have been instructed to completely start the web app from scratch, retaining the existing code for the UI and UX. Dr. Mckoy will instruct her data science students to research AWS for their remaining 2 weeks. Once they are in AWS, they should be able to do what they need to regarding data visualization and then construct video documentation for us to understand and review. Dr. Mckoy acknowledged that the previous group had great difficulty regarding AWS and was satisfied with our progress so far. Obviously, a lot more progress is needed in a very short time frame. If we get AWS in working order, we may consult her with a quick zoom call to demonstrate the functional software. 

## Things Clarified
We clarified that our iteration 3 review meeting will occur likely near the first week of Feburary.
