## Topics Discussed
We confirmed with Wyatt that we have completed major points of functionality, those being: A functional camera with the real headset and a csv generator for all user session data within an organization that provides organizational averages that can be compared to other ogranizations. We also confirmed that we now have front-end test coverage that encompasses far more files that before. He was satisfied with our work this iteration. 
## Things Clarified
Wyatt reminded us that we need to get coordinate with our client to finish off the semester. We need to hand over Github premissions to our repos as well as usable exe's. We said goodbye to Wyatt and thanked him for all of this guidance throughout the past 2 semesters.
