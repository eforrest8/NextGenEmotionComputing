9:30 - We all looked at our current UI together
9:55 - We worked together on the UI interface
## Topics Discussed
We discussed on what features that got completed since last meeting. We also talked about the UI and what needed to be change.
## Things Clarified
We clarified on what are some of the violations with our UI features and how as a team we can revise it. Ben also clarified to Ethan and I about the delete button only able to delete user that does not have data in them. This mean that user with data in them already will give an error when user try to delete them.
## Tasks Distributed
Ben will work on session sidebar brighter color. I will work on text orginization panel, Ethan will work on ID column in user dashboard, and Peter will work on login feedback for wrong password and username.
## Progress made 
We were able to get the file to upload along with the time and date on the dashboard. We planned on getting the file to upload properly with notes.
