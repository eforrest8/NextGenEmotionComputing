## Topics Discussed
We talked about the poster and what to put on there with what we planned to have for iteration 5. We also discussed about whether we want to have a meeting with her online or go down to Indy to meet in person to clarify some of the feature we will be working on.
## Things Clarified
We clarify on what other impactful features we need to add for iteration 5 since we only have 3 minor features so far. 
## Tasks Distributed
We will slowly get started on the symposium poster together and look at some of the features together before deligating tasks.
